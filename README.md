Welcome to the VacationHere application! This project demonstrates the development of a vacation management application that allows users to manage their vacations and excursions. The application supports the addition, modification, and deletion of vacations and excursions, as well as setting reminders for upcoming trips.


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase the application of mobile application development principles and skills, including user interface design, backend development, data management, and secure database integration. The project focuses on creating an easy-to-use, scalable solution to help users organize their vacation and excursion data efficiently.

## Project Features
Intuitive interface for organizing vacations and trips
Option to add, edit, remove, and set alerts for vacation and trip information
Protected database for safeguarding user information
